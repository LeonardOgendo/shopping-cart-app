## 🛒 Shopping Cart App – Redux Toolkit

This project is a frontend-only Shopping Cart application built with **React** and **Redux Toolkit**. It’s designed to demonstrate modern state management using Redux, including `configureStore`, `createSlice`, `useSelector`, `useDispatch`, and optionally `createAsyncThunk` for async logic.

## 🧠 Purpose

This app serves as a hands-on project to **master Redux state management**, especially using Redux Toolkit best practices.

It’s part of a two-project setup:
- ✅ **Notes App** – built with `useReducer` + `useContext`
- ✅ **Shopping Cart App** – built with **Redux Toolkit**

This dual approach makes it easier to understand the difference between **React Context** and **Redux** in real-world scenarios.
